# Drawino

Drawino is a platform enabling the user to draw on a whiteboard without touching it.
User can draw something on his phone/tablet and watch it being printed on the board
in real time or load an existing picture to the app and it will be printed as well.

The project uses Arduino, Azure cloud functions and Bluetooth communication.
